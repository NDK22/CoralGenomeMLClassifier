# Cladocopium Machine Learning Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on the algorithmic analysis for Cladocopium classification based on the host coral species (Orbicella annularis, OANN) using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the classification performance and identify significant features contributing to the classification outcome.

## Algorithms Used

The following machine learning algorithms were applied for Cladocopium classification:

- Logistic Regression
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Partial Least Squares (PLS)

For each algorithm, default settings were utilized, and specific hyperparameters were tuned to enhance classification performance.

## Method Description

### Logistic Regression

**Explanation:**
Logistic regression is a supervised algorithm used for binary classification. It models the probability of a class given input features.

**Customization:**
Adjusted regularization parameters to prevent overfitting.
